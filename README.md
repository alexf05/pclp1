This project contains all the materials that I did in the first semester at Computer Science.  
For them to run, i use docker with an ubuntu environment; the "start" script works on a UNIX based, system, i use a Macbook.  
It contains 13 labs, the solving from the university site: https://acs-pclp.github.io  
Also it has 3 homeworks, the descriptions are in each one of them (if i found them).  
All the materials are for educated purposes only, and should not be publicated on the internet without my knowledge.
