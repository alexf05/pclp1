This project contains all the materials that I did in the first semester at Computer Science.
It contains 13 labs, the solving from the university site: https://acs-pclp.github.io
Also it has 3 homeworks, the descriptions are in each one of them (if i found them).
All the materials are for educated purposes only, and should not be publicated on the internet without my knowledge.
